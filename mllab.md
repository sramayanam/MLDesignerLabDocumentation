# Azure ML Designer Lab

## Background

Your taxi Commission for a major city has asked you to create a machine learning model that takes various trip attributes and predict the tip amount driver might expect. This helps the Commission some answers for their drivers to maximize their profit.

## Learning Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to Azure Machine Learning designer to feature engineer the data and train a regression model from the dataset you created using the Azure data factory.

## The Data

We use the data from the previous exercise. we created a ready made dataset in the Azure ML Workspace named *taxidata* to save some time for you. Let's use this to start Modeling.

## Create a Training Pipeline

- Login to the ML Workspace on the left pane click designer as shown below by clicking "Designer Icon" followed by "New pipeline"
